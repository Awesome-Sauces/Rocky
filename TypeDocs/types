All types that will be in rocky

Simple

UNFINISHED - int - can store up to integer limit

UNFINISHED - string - can store any string and can even be +='d to just like an int

UNFINISHED - double - I don't like floats so it will be a double instead

Non - Simple

UNFINISHED - class - this will tell rocky that you are making a "class" type. Classes in rocky will work
	as a type but are an extension of the normal "type"
	
UNFINISHED - list - The list type will be an extension of the "class" type, it will hold data in string
		    form unless told to use int form of storage 	
	
UNFINISHED - enum - This will work just as java enums but when called upon will return an int that
		    say it's position in the enum "list" (Enums are an extension of lists)	
		    
General Program Stuff

UNFINISHED - func - This will be like a normal function that you can find in Python, Golang and 
                    many more programming languages.
                    
UNFINISHED - variable/var - This will be stored GLOBALLY
